Hello and welcome to NightSky!
Here's a quick introduction so you can make your very own audible constellations.

Using the program:
 * To select a chord, press a star. To add a star to your constellation,
   press another star and the star will be connected with the previous star by a white line.
 * To play your constellation back through your operating system's General MIDI soundfont, press the Play button.
 * To save to your constellation to a MIDI-file, press the Save to MIDI button. The MIDI file will be stored in the same folder as the program is located in.
 * To undo the addition of a star to your constellation, press the Undo button.

How the program works:
 * The position of a star on the Y-axis determines the pitch of that star chord.
 * The length between two stars determines the length of the pause between two chords.
 * The angle of the lines between three stars determine the playtime of the middle star.

Have fun!
