Hello and welcome to NightSky!
Here's a quick introduction so you can make your very own audible constellations.
=============================================
Using the program:
1) To select a chord, press a star. To add a star to your constellation,
press another star and the star will be connected with the previous star by a white line.
2) To play your constellation back through your operating system's General MIDI
soundfont, press the Play button.
3) To save to your constellation to a MIDI-file, press the Save to MIDI button.
The MIDI file will be stored in the same folder as the program is located in.
4) To undo the addition of a star to your constellation, press the Undo button.
=============================================
How the program works:
1) The position of a star on the Y-axis determines the pitch of that star chord.
2) The length between two stars determines the length of the pause between two chords.
3) The angle of the lines between three stars determine the playtime of the middle star.
=============================================
Have fun!
