Hello and welcome to NightSky!
Here's a quick introduction,
so you can make your very own audible constellations.
===================================
Using the program:
1) To select a chord, press a star.
To add a star to your constellation,
press another star and the star will
be connected with the previous star by a white line.
2) To play your constellation, press the Play button.
3) Press the Save to MIDI button,
to save current constellation's music.
The MIDI file is saved in the same folder as the program.
4) To undo the addition of a star, press the Undo button.
===================================
How the program works:
1) Y-axis determines the pitch of that star chord.
2) The length between two stars determines
the length of the pause between two chords.
3) The angle of the lines between three stars
determine the playtime of the middle star.
===================================
Have fun!
