Hello and welcome to NightSky!
Here's a quick introduction,
so you can make your very own audible constellations.

Using the program:
- Click on a star to select it.
- To add more stars to your constellation, click on another star,
  and the star will be connected with the previous star by a white line.
- To play your constellation, click Play.
- Click "Save to MIDI" to save the current constillation as a MIDI file.
  The MIDI file will be saved in the application directory.
- To undo the last placed star, click Undo.

How constellations translate to music:
- One star represents one chord.
- Stars are played in the order they are added.
- The Y-axis determines the pitch of a chord.
- The distance between two stars determine the length of the pause between two chords.
- The angles determine the playtime of the chords. The tighter the angle, the shorter the playtime.

Have fun!
