Hello and welcome to the Nightsky!
Here's a quick introduction so you can make your very own audible constellations!
To make chords, click the stars. There will be drawn lines that connects the stars.
The angle of the line between two stars determines the length of the chords.
The position of a star on the Y-axis determines the pitch of that star chord,
and the length between two stars determines the length of the pause between two chords.

When you're done making a constellation, you can click Play to hear the constellation,
or you can save the MIDI file for use in other software.
And Undo and Exit should be pretty self-explanatory.
